    The pin for ``setuptools<69.3`` in ``pyproject.toml`` has been removed.
    This pin was to prevent a sudden change in setuptools to use :pep:`625`
    from taking place, which would change the file name of SQLAlchemy's source
    distribution on pypi to be an all lower case name, which is likely to cause
    problems with various build environments that expected the previous naming
    style.  However, the presence of this pin is holding back environments that
    otherwise want to use a newer setuptools, so we've decided to move forward
    with this change, with the assumption that build environments will have
    largely accommodated the setuptools change by now.

    This change was first released in version 2.0.33 however is being
    backported to 1.4.54 to support ongoing releases.
