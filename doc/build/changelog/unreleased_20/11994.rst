    The :class:`.postgresql.JSON` and :class:`.postgresql.JSONB` datatypes will
    now render a "bind cast" in all cases for all PostgreSQL backends,
    including psycopg2, whereas previously it was only enabled for some
    backends.   This allows greater accuracy in allowing the database server to
    recognize when a string value is to be interpreted as JSON.
