    Refined the check which the ORM lazy loader uses to detect "this would be
    loading by primary key and the primary key is NULL, skip loading" to take
    into account the current setting for the
    :paramref:`.orm.Mapper.allow_partial_pks` parameter. If this parameter is
    ``False``, then a composite PK value that has partial NULL elements should
    also be skipped.   This can apply to some composite overlapping foreign key
    configurations.
