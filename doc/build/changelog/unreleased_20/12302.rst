    Reorganized the internals by which the ``.c`` collection on a
    :class:`.FromClause` gets generated so that it is resilient against the
    collection being accessed in concurrent fashion.   An example is creating a
    :class:`.Alias` or :class:`.Subquery` and accessing it as a module level
    variable.  This impacts the Oracle dialect which uses such module-level
    global alias objects but is of general use as well.
