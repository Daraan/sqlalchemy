    Fixed bug in ORM "update with WHERE clause" feature where an explicit
    ``.returning()`` would interfere with the "fetch" synchronize strategy due
    to an assumption that the ORM mapped class featured the primary key columns
    in a specific position within the RETURNING.  This has been fixed to use
    appropriate ORM column targeting.
