    Revising the asyncpg ``terminate()`` fix first made in :ticket:`10717`
    which improved the resiliency of this call under all circumstances, adding
    ``asyncio.CancelledError`` to the list of exceptions that are intercepted
    as failing for a graceful ``.close()`` which will then proceed to call
    ``.terminate()``.
