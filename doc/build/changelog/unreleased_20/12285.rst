    Changed default connection pool used by the ``aiosqlite`` dialect
    from :class:`.NullPool` to :class:`.AsyncAdaptedQueuePool`; this change
    should have been made when 2.0 was first released as the ``pysqlite``
    dialect was similarly changed to use :class:`.QueuePool` as detailed
    in :ref:`change_7490`.
