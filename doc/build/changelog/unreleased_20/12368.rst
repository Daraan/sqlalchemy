    Fixed issue that omitted the comma between multiple SQLite table extension
    clauses, currently ``WITH ROWID`` and ``STRICT``, when both options
    :paramref:`.Table.sqlite_with_rowid` and  :paramref:`.Table.sqlite_strict`
    were configured at their non-default settings at the same time.  Pull
    request courtesy david-fed.
