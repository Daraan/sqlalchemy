    Fixed regression caused by issue :ticket:`11814` which broke support for
    certain flavors of :pep:`593` ``Annotated`` in the type_annotation_map when
    builtin types such as ``list``, ``dict`` were used without an element type.
    While this is an incomplete style of typing, these types nonetheless
    previously would be located in the type_annotation_map correctly.
