    Fixed issue where the "is ORM" flag of a :func:`.select` or other ORM
    statement would not be propagated to the ORM :class:`.Session` based on a
    multi-part operator expression alone, e.g. such as ``Cls.attr + Cls.attr +
    Cls.attr`` or similar, leading to ORM behaviors not taking place for such
    statements.
