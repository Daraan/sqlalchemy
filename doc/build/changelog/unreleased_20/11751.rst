    Add SQL typing to reflection query used to retrieve a the structure
    of IDENTITY columns, adding explicit JSON typing to the query to suit
    unusual PostgreSQL driver configurations that don't support JSON natively.

.. change::
    :tags: bug, postgresql

    Fixed issue affecting PostgreSQL 17.3 and greater where reflection of
    domains with "NOT NULL" as part of their definition would include an
    invalid constraint entry in the data returned by
    :meth:`_postgresql.PGInspector.get_domains` corresponding to an additional
    "NOT NULL" constraint that isn't a CHECK constraint; the existing
    ``"nullable"`` entry in the dictionary already indicates if the domain
    includes a "not null" constraint.   Note that such domains also cannot be
    reflected on PostgreSQL 17.0 through 17.2 due to a bug on the PostgreSQL
    side; if encountering errors in reflection of domains which include NOT
    NULL, upgrade to PostgreSQL server 17.3 or greater.
